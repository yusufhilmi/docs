We are building Polymet as an AI Product Designer that helps teams and individuals create stunning designs and production-ready front-end codes more efficiently than ever before. Each Polymet project represents a product or application you're designing, serving as a comprehensive workspace for all your design needs.

## What is a Polymet Project?

A Polymet project is your digital canvas where ideas come to life. It's where you'll:

- Generate AI-powered designs
- Create and organize components
- Build interactive prototypes
- Collaborate with your team
- Export production-ready code

Think of it as your product's digital home, where every aspect of your design journey unfolds.

## Create a New Project

Let's get started with creating a project and generating pages.

### Step 1: Start Your Project

1. Log into your Polymet account
2. Click on "New Project" from your dashboard
3. Name your project and add a brief description
4. Choose a template or start from scratch

### Step 2: Generate Your First Design

**Enter your prompt and get your first generation.**
Prompts can be images, texts, or context. Let your creativity flow - our AI is here to interpret and bring your ideas to life.

### Step 3: Refine and Iterate

**Edit the parts of it to reach your ideal design.**
You can just leave a comment, like interacting with your designer. Our AI understands context and will implement your feedback seamlessly.
