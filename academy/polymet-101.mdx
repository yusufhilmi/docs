We are building Polymet as an AI Product Designer that helps teams and individuals create stunning designs and production-ready front-end codes more efficiently than ever before. 

It is designed for creating crafted interfaces and experiences, but to unlock the full potential of Polymet, here is a quick overview that you can start quickly.


## Create a New Project
Let's get started with creating a project and generating pages. 

**Enter your prompt and get your first generation.** 
Prompts can be images, texts, or context

**Edit the parts of it to reach your ideal design.** 
You can just leave a comment, like interacting with your designer.

## Create Components and Add it to Pages

Components ensure consistency, which leads to a great UX. You can create a variety of components *by just prompting* them to your specific needs. You can also easily integrate your pages and prototypes.

**Create components**

## Create Variations of Components 

You’re creating pages and components and generating your design. *We believe and see that design is more than that.* It's not just the interface; it's the user experience, and you have to explore lots of ideas to craft the best UX.

> Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works. - Steve.

**Create variations, and specify what kinds of variety you want.** 

**Iterate as well to get the best out of it.**

## Prototyping and Code Export

After piecing together the pages and components to create unique experiences -stories of your ideas and solutions to your users’ problems. Let's take it to the next level by bringing your designs to life with prototyping and getting ready for development.

**Create interactive prototypes** Get its preview links and share them with your team, friends, and followers.

**Export your designs to production-ready front-end codes** Deploy them for your users and customers.
